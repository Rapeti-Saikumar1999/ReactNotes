//what is react ?
// is a open source library(some has wrote we are using it) for building user interfaces

why node is installed for react app?
node is a runtime env which helps to run the js code outside the browser directly.
and also the script to install react application is based on node (npx create-react-app app-01)

npm - node package manager(helps in installing dependencies in the project using node.js)
ex: npm install axios
npm uninstall axios

for specific version -> npm i axios@....;

for latest -> npm i axios@latest

for global install  -> npm i -g axios@latest



npx - node package executer() - allows us to run javascript packages without installing it(used only once).


package.json - tells what kind of dependencies this application is holding currently.


package-lock.json - advanced version of package.json gives u dependencies of dependencies and theirs versions.


node_modules - all the scripts of dependencies will be present 


npm install - install all the dependencies


gitignore - to untrack the particular files


public and src - are main folders to show the content

src - 

pubic - 

ReactDOM - how? & where?

React - what ? to mount

we should only return only one div in a particular component

*/


// why react?
// to simplify DOM manipulation
// faster making UI
// learning curve is less
// easy to understand

// components - superPower(reusablity of piece of code)
  
// code maintainablity - high vice Versa code readability
